# sikuli-type_alt

**WHY?**

This simple sikuli module (python based) was wrote to allow "typing" on Sikuli.
There are some situations we need to type a text eg. (type-and-search fields)
So instead of using type() (which returns a java.lang.IllegalArgumentException ( java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Key: Not supported character), you should use type_alt() function.
**Observation**: You should use **paste()** function always as possible for accented chars text entries. Only prefer **type_alt()** when **typing** is extremely required by interface being automated. üëäüèªüòâ

**HOW IT WORKS?**

Due to ASCII incompatibility between JAVA and Python present in Sikuli, some characters are not inserted or simply return java error (mentioned above).
One possible way to do this character entry, regardless of the language or keyboard layout, is through an old ALT keystroke technique that is used in this code.

**USAGE**

 1. Place type_alt.sikuli on the same others sikuli¬¥s projects directory(strongly recommended for sikulixIDE), or import type_alt.py file.
 2. On the top of your sikuli script type:
import type_alt
reload(type_alt)
from type_alt import *
 3. YOU ARE DONE!

Now everytime you need to **type** accented/special characters, you can use type_alt() instead of type()

**EXAMPLE**

    import type_alt
    reload(type_alt)
    from type_alt import *
    
    
    txt=u"L√∫cia, S√¥nia, Jo√£o, Patr√≠cia, F√°bio and Andr√© are names containing accented chars!"
    type_alt(txt)
